# Bright Boost – Back-End

## Overview
Express.js API server with JWT authentication and a mock in-memory database for development purposes. The backend provides API endpoints for both teacher and student user roles, supporting the educational platform's core functionality.

## Architecture
![Back-End Diagram](../docs/architecture/Back_End_Diagram.png)

The diagram above shows the target architecture for the BrightBoost backend, including the key components and their interactions.

## Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server with hot-reload
npm run dev:server

# Start both frontend and backend concurrently
npm run dev:full

# Start production server
npm run start
```

## Environment Variables
| Variable | Description | Default Value |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| JWT_SECRET | Secret key for JWT token signing | 'your-secret-key' |
| PORT | Server port number | 3000 |
| NODE_ENV | Environment mode (development/production) | development |

## Directory Structure

## Scripts
| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| server | Runs the server using node |
| start | Builds the frontend and starts the server in production mode |
| dev:server | Runs the server with nodemon for hot-reloading |
| dev:full | Concurrently runs both frontend and backend development servers |

## API Reference
| Method | Path | Description | Auth Required |
|--------|------|-------------|---------------|
| POST | /auth/signup | Register a new user (teacher or student) | No |
| POST | /auth/login | Authenticate a user and receive JWT token | No |
| GET | /api/teacher/dashboard | Get teacher dashboard data (classes, students) | Yes (teacher) |
| GET | /api/student/dashboard | Get student dashboard data (courses, assignments) | Yes (student) |
| GET | /api/profile | Get user profile information | Yes |

### Authentication
The API uses JWT-based authentication. After login, include the token in requests:
```
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
```

## Extending the Backend
The backend currently uses a mock in-memory database for development. To replace this with a real database:

1. Add a database connection using MongoDB, PostgreSQL with Prisma, or another solution
2. Create database models to replace the mock data structures
3. Update route handlers to use database queries instead of in-memory operations
4. Update environment variables to include database connection details

## Deployment
For production deployment to Azure, refer to the [AZURE_DEPLOYMENT.md](../AZURE_DEPLOYMENT.md) file. The deployment configuration includes setting up an Azure App Service with appropriate environment variables for the production environment.

## How README Stays Up to Date
This README is auto-regenerated by Devin 2.0 with every backend code, API, env, or script change. This ensures documentation always reflects the current state of the codebase.
