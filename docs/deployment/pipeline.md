# BrightBoost Deployment Pipeline

This document outlines the CI/CD pipeline for the BrightBoost application.

## Overview

The BrightBoost CI/CD pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment processes for both the frontend and backend components of the application. It uses GitHub Actions to:

1. Build and test the application
2. Deploy the frontend to Azure Static Web Apps
3. Deploy the backend to AWS Lambda + API Gateway

## GitHub Actions Workflows

The project uses two separate deployment workflows:

1. **azure-static-web-apps.yml**: Deploys the React frontend to Azure Static Web Apps
2. **aws-lambda-deploy.yml**: Deploys the backend Lambda functions to AWS with API Gateway

## Environment Variables and Secrets

The following environment variables and secrets are required for the deployment pipeline:

### GitHub Secrets (to be added in GitHub repository settings)

#### Azure Static Web Apps
- `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN_BRAVE_BAY_0BFACC110`: Deployment token for Azure SWA

#### AWS Lambda Deployment
- `AWS_ROLE_ARN`: IAM role ARN for OIDC authentication
- `DATABASE_SECRET_ARN`: AWS Secrets Manager ARN for Aurora credentials
- `VPC_ID`: VPC ID where Aurora cluster is deployed
- `SUBNET_IDS`: Comma-separated subnet IDs (same as Aurora)
- `SECURITY_GROUP_ID`: Security group allowing Aurora access

### Environment Variables

#### Frontend (Azure SWA)
- `VITE_AWS_API_URL`: AWS API Gateway endpoint URL

#### Backend (AWS Lambda)
- `DATABASE_SECRET_ARN`: AWS Secrets Manager ARN for Aurora credentials
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT token signing

## Deployment Process

### Automatic Deployments

The pipeline automatically deploys the application when:

1. Changes are pushed to the main branch
2. The workflow is manually triggered

### Manual Deployments

To manually trigger the deployment pipeline:

1. Go to the Actions tab in the GitHub repository
2. Select the "BrightBoost CI/CD Pipeline" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select the branch to deploy and click "Run workflow"

## Adding Secrets to GitHub

To add the required secrets to the GitHub repository:

1. Go to the repository settings
2. Select "Secrets and variables" > "Actions"
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Add the required secrets as described above

## Setting Up Azure Resources

Refer to the [Azure Deployment Configuration](../AZURE_DEPLOYMENT.md) document for instructions on setting up the required Azure resources.

## Creating an Azure Service Principal

To create an Azure service principal for GitHub Actions:

```bash
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "BrightBoostGitHubActions" --role contributor \
                          --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/bb-dev-rg \
                          --sdk-auth
```

The output of this command should be saved as the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret in GitHub.

## AWS Lambda Deployment Configuration

The backend is now deployed to AWS Lambda instead of Azure Functions. AWS deployment uses OIDC authentication with GitHub Actions:

1. Configure the AWS IAM role with the required permissions
2. Set up the GitHub repository secrets for AWS authentication
3. The deployment uses AWS SAM for infrastructure as code
4. Lambda functions are automatically deployed via the GitHub Actions workflow

## Monitoring Deployments

After a deployment, you can monitor the application using Azure Application Insights. For more information, refer to the [Azure Dashboard and Alerts](../azure/dashboard-alerts.md) document.
