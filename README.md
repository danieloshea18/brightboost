# BrightBoost: Interactive Learning Platform

BrightBoost is an interactive learning platform designed to help teachers create engaging lessons and students to learn in a fun, gamified environment.

## Key Features

- **Teacher Accounts & Dashboard:** Teachers can sign up, log in, and manage their lessons through a dedicated dashboard.
- **Student Accounts & Dashboard:** Students can sign up, log in, and access assigned lessons and activities.
- **Lesson Creation & Management:** Teachers can create, edit, and delete lessons, including title, content, category, and status.
- **Student Lesson Viewing & Activity Tracking:** Students can view lessons assigned to them and mark activities as complete.
- **Persistent Data Storage:** User and lesson data is stored persistently using Aurora PostgreSQL (AWS RDS).
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Clear distinction between teacher and student functionalities.
- **E2E Tested Core Flow:** The primary user journeys for teachers and students have been tested.

## Demo Flow Summary

A typical demo showcases:

1.  A **teacher** signing up or logging in.
2.  The teacher navigating their dashboard and creating a new lesson (e.g., "Introduction to Photosynthesis", Category: "Science", Content: "Learn about how plants make food.", Status: "Published").
3.  The teacher verifying the lesson is displayed on their dashboard.
4.  The teacher logging out.
5.  A **student** signing up or logging in.
6.  The student viewing the "Introduction to Photosynthesis" lesson on their dashboard.
7.  The student marking an activity associated with this lesson as "complete".
8.  The student logging out.

## Technologies Used

This project is built with a modern web technology stack:

- **Frontend:**
  - React
  - Vite
  - TypeScript
  - Tailwind CSS
  - shadcn-ui (for UI components)
  - React Router (for navigation)
  - Context API (for state management, e.g., AuthContext)
- **Backend:**
  - AWS Lambda with API Gateway
  - Aurora PostgreSQL (AWS RDS)
  - JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication
  - `bcryptjs` for password hashing

**Architecture:** Frontend: Azure Static Web Apps | Backend: AWS Lambda + API Gateway | Database: Aurora PostgreSQL (RDS)
- **Testing:**
  - Vitest (for unit/integration tests)
  - Cypress (for End-to-End tests)
- **Development Tools:**
  - ESLint (for linting)
  - Storybook (for UI component development and testing)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

**Installation & Setup:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL> # Replace <YOUR_GIT_URL> with the actual Git URL of this project
    cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>   # Replace <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME> with the directory name
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This will install both frontend and backend dependencies.

    ```sh
    npm install
    cd src/lambda && npm install && cd ../..
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project:

    ```env
    VITE_AWS_API_URL=https://your-api-gateway-url.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/stage
    ```

    Replace with your actual AWS API Gateway URL. Backend environment variables are managed through AWS Secrets Manager.

## API Configuration

The application uses `VITE_AWS_API_URL` to configure the backend API endpoint:

- **Development**: Uses environment variable or defaults to production endpoint
- **Production**: Set via Azure Static Web App configuration in Azure Portal
- **Testing**: All authentication flows (login/signup for both teachers and students) use this single endpoint

### Cypress Production Testing

To run Cypress tests against production or staging environments:

```bash
# Test smoke tests against production
CYPRESS_BASE_URL=https://brave-bay-0bfacc110-production.centralus.6.azurestaticapps.net npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/smoke.cy.ts"

# Test all tests against production
CYPRESS_BASE_URL=https://brave-bay-0bfacc110-production.centralus.6.azurestaticapps.net npx cypress run

# Test against staging
CYPRESS_BASE_URL=https://your-staging-url.azurestaticapps.net npx cypress run
```

The Cypress configuration automatically uses `CYPRESS_BASE_URL` environment variable when provided, falling back to `http://localhost:5173` for local development. The smoke tests will automatically handle authentication by seeding tokens in localStorage.

4.  **Running the Application:**
    To run the frontend Vite development server:

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

    This command starts:

    - Frontend (Vite): `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy)

5.  **Running the Backend Locally:**
    The backend now runs on AWS Lambda. For local development, you can use the mock server:
    ```sh
    npm run server
    ```
    This will start a local Express server for development.

## Production Deployment

**Live Application:** https://brave-bay-0bfacc110-production.centralus.6.azurestaticapps.net

The application is deployed using Azure Static Web Apps for the frontend with an AWS Lambda backend.

## Deployment

This project uses a hybrid deployment approach:

### Backend Deployment (AWS Lambda)

The backend is deployed to AWS Lambda using GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline. The deployment workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/aws-lambda-deploy.yml`.

**Backend Infrastructure:**

- **AWS Lambda** for serverless backend functions
- **Aurora PostgreSQL** (AWS RDS) for data persistence
- **API Gateway** for HTTP API endpoints
- **AWS Secrets Manager** for secure credential storage

### Frontend Deployment (Azure Static Web Apps)

The frontend continues to be deployed to Azure Static Web Apps for optimal performance and global distribution.

**Frontend URL:** https://brave-bay-0bfacc110-production.centralus.6.azurestaticapps.net

### Deployment Pipeline

The deployment pipeline:

1. **Frontend**: Builds and deploys React application to Azure Static Web Apps
2. **Backend**: Builds TypeScript Lambda functions and deploys to AWS using SAM
3. **Database**: Uses Aurora PostgreSQL cluster in AWS
4. **API Integration**: Frontend calls AWS API Gateway endpoints directly

**Environment Variables:**

- `VITE_AWS_API_URL`: AWS API Gateway endpoint URL
- Backend credentials stored in AWS Secrets Manager

## Troubleshooting Auth Redirects

### Common Issues

**"Failed to fetch" errors during login/signup:**

- Ensure `VITE_AWS_API_URL` is set correctly in your `.env` file
- Check that the AWS Lambda endpoints are deployed and accessible
- Verify network connectivity to AWS API Gateway

**Redirects not working after login/signup:**

- Check browser localStorage for `brightboost_token` key (not `token`)
- Ensure user object contains valid `role` field ('teacher' or 'student')
- Check browser console for navigation errors

**Token not persisting across page reloads:**

- Verify `brightboost_token` is stored in localStorage
- Check that AuthContext is properly wrapping your app
- Ensure token hasn't expired (24-hour expiration)

**API calls failing with authentication errors:**

- Verify `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header is attached to requests
- Check that token is valid and not expired
- Ensure API endpoints are configured to accept JWT tokens

## STEM-1-MVP Environment

For the stem-1-mvp delivery lane, add the following secret to GitHub repository settings:
- `STEM1_MVP_SWA_TOKEN`: Azure Static Web App deployment token for brightboost-stem1-mvp

The staging environment will be available at: `https://brightboost-stem1-mvp.azurestaticapps.net`

## Provisioning STEM-1-MVP Environment

To provision the Azure Static Web App for the stem-1-mvp delivery lane:

1. Ensure you have Azure CLI installed and are logged in: `az login`
2. Ensure you have GitHub CLI installed and are authenticated: `gh auth login`
3. Run the provisioning script: `bash scripts/provision-stem1-swa.sh`

This will create the `brightboost-stem1-mvp` Static Web App and automatically add the `STEM1_MVP_SWA_TOKEN` secret to the repository.

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test types
npm run test:unit
npm run test:e2e
npm run lint
```

For detailed testing information, see the [Testing Guide](./docs/TESTING.md).

## Custom Domains

For deployments to Azure Static Web Apps, custom domains can be configured directly within the Azure Portal under the Static Web App's "Custom domains" section. SSL certificates are automatically provisioned for custom domains.
